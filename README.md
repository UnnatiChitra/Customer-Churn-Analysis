# Customer-Churn-Analysis

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Loaded the provided dataset and conducted a detailed EDA.
Identified and handle missing values, if any.
Performed univariate and bivariate analysis to understand patterns (e.g., churn distribution, relationship between tenure and monthly charges).
Visualized important trends using graphs and charts.
## 2. Feature Engineering
Created new features (e.g., average spend per month, usage patterns).
Encoded categorical variables and scale numerical ones.
## 3. Predictive Modeling
Build and compared the performance of the following models to predict churn:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
  
Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Included a confusion matrix for the best-performing model.
## 4. Model Interpretation
Used feature importance techniques (e.g., SHAP or feature importance plots) to interpret the results.
Identified which factors contribute most to customer churn.
## 5. Recommendation Engine
Build a collaborative filtering-based recommendation engine to suggest additional services/products to customers based on their usage patterns.
